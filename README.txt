Running the code

- Each individual part of the program has it's own README.txt to tell you how to run that specific program,
  but I will discuss some common points here

  1. When running the given commands for each program, simply download the program from the marking page, 
     then extract the zip file, and follow the instructions in the respective READMEs for each part.
  
  2. All parts of this program have been coded in python
